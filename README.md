# SiemLogicLibrary
SIEM Security Use Case Library

The purpose of this git is to be an opensource, threat-based, use case library for any security professional wanting more out of their SIEM but don't have the experience or background on how this should be done. 

This framework will map use cases to multiple detection logic, dependencies (both data dependencies and configuration dependencies), severity, Processes to MITRE PRE&POST ATT&CK frameworks, along with the Cyber Kill Chain.

Project Pipeline:
1. Documentation of Use Cases in the Library
2. Review Framework and Add/Remove additional information depending on requirements
3. Port Library into a DB for integration into different SIEM platform
4. Create Code that Automatically integrates/update Use case library into existing SIEM deployment
